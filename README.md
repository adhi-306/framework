TestNG Framework Development for Automation Testing of Trello Application

I have developed a TestNG framework for automation testing of the Trello application. This framework incorporates the TestNG testing framework, allowing for efficient and structured test case execution. It aims to ensure the reliability and quality of the Trello application by automating various functional and integration tests.

-Trello application is a popular web-based project management and collaboration tool. It provides a visual interface with boards, lists, and cards, allowing users to organize and prioritize tasks, projects, or workflows.
